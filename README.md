# Alpheios Safari App Extension - background part

The project consists of the following folders:
- **AlpheiosV2.xcodeproj** - the folder with XCode project files
- **AlpheiosV2** - the folder with application files (I didn't touch it at all, it has only default template data)
- **AlpheiosSafariV2** - the folder with safari app extension files (here it is all my work)
- **dist** - **.app** built and **.dmg** build


## AlpheiosSafariV2 files

### Info.plist

[About Safari App Extension Default Keys](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/safari_app_extensions/safari_app_extension_info_property_list_keys/about_safari_app_extension_default_keys)

This file consists of properties for the app extension.
I am using these keys in the **NSExtension** section:

Name | Description
------------ | -------------
SFSafariContextMenu | It contains the data for each context item that could appear using app extension. 
SFSafariStyleSheet | It contains the name for the stylesheet from safari-app-front. 
SFSafariContentScript | It contains the name for the js script from safari-app-front. 
SFSafariToolbarItem | It contains the data for toolbaritem.
SFSafariWebsiteAccess | It is for defining the access from tabs (I am using simply full access - didn't dive into it here).

### script.js, script.map.js, style.css

It is compiled data from [safari-app-front repo](https://github.com/alpheios-project/safari-app-front)

## Developer info

### Running an app extension from Xcode
1. Open the Xcode project files. Those files are located in a directory with a `.xcodeproj` extension.
2. Select an active scheme to use. A scheme selector is located near a run button in a toolbar. Please read more on 
schemes below.
2. Run the build. If necessary, a build will be compiled before running automatically.
3. Open a Safari browser.
4. Check **Allow Unsigned Extensions** in a **Develop** menu.
5. Go to **Preferences** -> **Extensions** and check a box against an extension name.
6. Reload the page. Safari app extension should be fully functional at this moment.

### Schema selection for running an extension
Safari app extension is stored within a hosting macOS app. So the one way to run it is to run a corresponding
macOS app. For this, choose an **AlpheiosV2** app schema marked with a stylized letter **A** (meaning application).

The other way is to run a Safari app extension directly. For this, an **AlpheiosSafariV2** schema shall be used.
It is marked with a blue letter **E** (meaning extension) inside a white circle. It will ask what app
should it run. Choose **Safari** from the list of apps offered. An instance of Safari web browser will
open. In the browser, allow unsigned extensions and activate an Alpheios extension by checking a box
next to its name as described in **How to run from XCode** section.

Using an app extension schema to run an extension will allow to attach debugger to a running extension and monitor it in
real time.

### Troubleshooting
If Safari does not see an app extension or it fails in some other way, close Safari, restart XCode
and repeat all steps from the beginning.
